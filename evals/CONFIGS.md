# Configuration ledger

Every agent configuration tried, with the verdict and the reason. Losing
changes are recorded too — knowing what didn't work is most of the value of
keeping the data at all, and it's what stops the same idea being re-tried every
few months.

Promotion rule (see [EVAL.md](../free_coding_agent/docs/EVAL.md#fair-comparison)):
promote when no task regresses by more than one trial **and** either success
rate improves beyond interval overlap, or success rate holds flat while a
secondary metric improves materially. Anything else is a draw, and a draw keeps
the simpler configuration.

| Config | Ref / SHA | Change | Suite | Result | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `baseline` | `e1e5417` | — | `retry-after-case` L0, n=2 | 1 pass, 1 crash | reference point |

### baseline, first measurement (2026-07-29)

Two reps of one L0 task. Not a rate — n=2 establishes the pipeline works and
gives a first look at variance, nothing more.

| | rep 1 | rep 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| outcome | pass | crash (`stopping`) |
| steps | 6 | 5 |
| provider calls | 10 | 11 |
| failover bounces | 4 | 8 |
| tokens in | 89,260 | 55,126 |
| distinct models | 5 | 7 |
| wall time | 19.4s | 15.6s |

Two observations already worth acting on:

1. **Rep 2 crashed on a dead model, not on the task.** Groq returns
   `404 model_not_found` for `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`. A 404
   is not in the router's transient set, so it propagates and kills the whole
   run. A decommissioned model in the pool should be disabled permanently and
   skipped, the same way a rate-limited one is skipped temporarily — otherwise
   one stale config entry can end an unattended run.
2. **A one-line fix costs 5–7 distinct models and ~90k input tokens.** The
   failover machinery works, but the pool is being walked hard for a trivial
   task. Worth understanding before reading anything into efficiency numbers.

## Stub configurations

`stub-*` are not real configurations. They drive `tests/fake_agent.py` to
exercise the runner's own paths (pass, each failure class, tampering) without
spending free-tier quota. Always run them with `--results` pointing somewhere
throwaway so they never enter the real record.

```bash
python -m runner run --config stub-fix --config stub-noop --config stub-badedit \
  --config stub-lost --config stub-tamper --reps 1 --results /tmp/selftest
```
